## Summary

**FortiBleed**, a newly reported credential leak, exposed Fortinet VPN login data associated with approximately **73,000 devices**. The disclosure surfaced on Hacker News on June 17, 2026, with BleepingComputer providing primary coverage. The dataset reportedly includes FortiGate SSL-VPN and related Fortinet edge appliance credentials collected through a combination of prior vulnerability exploitation and credential harvesting operations.

This is not a novel Fortinet CVE — it is a **credential aggregation event** that compounds years of FortiGate SSL-VPN weaknesses (CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2022-40684, CVE-2023-27997, and others) with fresh brute-force and infostealer-sourced data.

## Background

Fortinet appliances sit at the perimeter of tens of thousands of enterprises. SSL-VPN portals (`/remote/login`) have been perennial targets:

- **Path traversal** bugs leaking `sslvpn_websession` files with session cookies
- **Authentication bypass** flaws permitting admin interface access
- **Default credential** usage on rapid-deployment configs
- **Credential stuffing** against portals without lockout or MFA

FortiBleed appears to consolidate harvested credentials into a searchable corpus — similar in distribution model to prior "Collections" leaks but scoped to Fortinet VPN endpoints.

## Dataset Characteristics (Reported)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Scale | ~73,000 unique device entries |
| Content | VPN usernames, passwords, device hostnames/IPs |
| Source mix | Exploited appliances, stealer logs, brute-force success |
| Distribution | Underground forums, credential marketplaces |

Exact field composition varies by entry — some records include only portal URL + credentials; others include internal interface IPs and firmware versions useful for targeted follow-on exploitation.

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Risk

- **VPN portal credential stuffing** against organizations not yet rotated
- **Direct VPN access** where MFA is not enforced on SSL-VPN
- **Lateral movement** — VPN creds often match AD passwords (password reuse)
- **Ransomware initial access** — VPN is a preferred entry for commodity operators

### Secondary Risk

Leaked device hostnames and IPs enable **targeted scanning** for unpatched Fortinet CVEs on known appliances — attackers skip internet-wide scanning and probe specific victims.

## Indicators of Compromise

Monitor for:

- SSL-VPN logins from unexpected geolocations or concurrent sessions
- Successful auth from known residential proxy / bulletproof VPS IP ranges
- Admin logins following VPN compromise on same appliance
- New firewall policy rules or VPN user additions post-breach

FortiGate log fields: `type="event"` `subtype="vpn"` `action="tunnel-up"` with anomalous `srcip`.

## Mitigation

### Credential Hygiene (Immediate)

1. **Force password reset** for all SSL-VPN users — assume corpus contains valid creds.
2. **Rotate VPN pre-shared keys** and IPsec secrets.
3. **Enforce MFA** on all VPN authentication paths — hardware token or FIDO2, not SMS.
4. **Audit active sessions** — terminate unknown `sslvpn` sessions via CLI/API.

### Appliance Hardening

1. **Patch all Fortinet CVEs** — credential rotation without patching leaves re-harvest paths open.
2. **Restrict VPN portal** to known IP ranges or ZTNA broker — no internet-wide `/remote/login`.
3. **Disable SSL-VPN** if replaced by IPsec with certificate auth or ZTNA.
4. **Enable FortiGuard logging** to SIEM with alerting on auth anomalies.

### Identity

1. **Check AD password reuse** — VPN creds in leak may equal domain passwords.
2. **Invalidate refresh tokens** for M365/Google if VPN was SSO bridge.
