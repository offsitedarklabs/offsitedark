## Summary

Socket.dev disclosed a network of **152 Chrome live wallpaper extensions** conducting **ad fraud** and **fake traffic generation**. Combined installs exceeded **105,000**. Extensions mimicked legitimate Google search click patterns and falsified website referral traffic to monetize AdSense-style programs and affiliate networks.

The campaign highlights **anime-themed wallpaper extensions** as a high-trust vector for browser-based monetization fraud — users perceive wallpapers as low-risk cosmetic add-ons.

## Campaign Overview

### Extension Network

- **152 distinct extensions** — separate publisher accounts, shared backend infrastructure
- **105,000+ total installs** — distributed across long-tail wallpaper keywords
- **Theme clustering** — anime, gaming, nature live wallpapers
- **No obvious install hooks** — fraud triggers during normal browsing, not at install time

### Monetization Model

1. Extension injects or proxies browsing activity.
2. Simulates Google search result clicks (CTR inflation).
3. Generates fake referral traffic to AdSense-participating sites.
4. Collects affiliate/referral revenue via attacker-controlled sites.

Unlike traditional malvertising, victims may not see popup ads — fraud operates in **background tabs** or **headless request chains**.

## Technical Details

### Background Execution

Extensions abuse `chrome.declarativeNetRequest`, `webRequest`, or legacy `background.page` patterns to:

- Open hidden tabs to target URLs
- Inject click events on ad-bearing elements
- Rotate User-Agent and referrer headers to mimic organic traffic
- Schedule activity during victim "active hours" for statistical plausibility

### Evasion

- **Delayed activation** — benign behavior for days post-install
- **Publisher fragmentation** — 152 extensions avoids single-extension takedown
- **Minimal permissions display** — some use broad `<all_urls>` hidden behind wallpaper functionality
- **Clean Web Store pages** — screenshots and descriptions match legitimate wallpaper extensions

### Infrastructure

Shared C2 and config endpoints tie the network together despite distributed publisher accounts. Socket.dev correlated:

- Common JavaScript obfuscation patterns
- Shared analytics beacon domains
- Identical background script structure across publisher IDs

## Indicators of Compromise

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Extension | Live wallpaper extension with `<all_urls>` host permission |
| Behavior | CPU/network spike during idle browsing |
| Tabs | Hidden tabs to ad/affiliate domains in `chrome://extensions` disabled state |
| Network | Repeated HTTPS to unknown analytics domains from browser process |

**Enterprise:** Inventory Chrome extensions via GPO/Chrome Enterprise — flag live wallpaper category with broad permissions.

## Impact

**Users:** Battery drain, bandwidth consumption, potential privacy exposure via browsing pattern collection.

**Advertisers:** Click fraud degrades campaign metrics; budget diverted to fraudulent publishers.

**Publishers:** AdSense account termination risk if traffic classified as invalid.

**Enterprises:** Developer and analyst workstations with unvetted extensions leak internal browsing context to fraud networks.

## Mitigation

1. **Extension audit** — review installed live wallpaper extensions on all workstations.
2. **Enterprise policy** — block unvetted extension categories; allowlist approved extensions only.
3. **Remove `<all_urls>` wallpaper extensions** — wallpaper does not require all-site access.
4. **Monitor DNS** — alert on connections to correlated fraud infrastructure (Socket.dev published IOC list).
5. **User education** — wallpaper extensions are full browser plugins with page access, not passive images.
