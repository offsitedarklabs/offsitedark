## Summary

Between **01:12–02:36 UTC on June 17, 2026**, an attacker republished **140+ packages** in the `@mastra` npm scope after compromising a **dormant maintainer account** (`ehindero`). The `@mastra/core` package alone carries ~**918,000 weekly downloads**. Each poisoned manifest added a dependency on typosquat package **`easy-day-js`** — a clean-then-armed clone of `dayjs`.

The payload is a **cross-platform stealer** targeting browser extension data from **166 crypto-wallet and security extensions**, with tradecraft overlapping the **March 2026 Axios npm compromise** attributed to **Lazarus Group (North Korea)**.

## Attack Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 01:12 | First poisoned `@mastra/*` publish detected |
| 01:45 | `easy-day-js` typosquat package published |
| 02:36 | Last observed malicious publish in window |
| 03:00+ | Community detection; npm security response |

**Total window:** ~84 minutes — sufficient for CI/CD pipelines on nightly schedules to ingest poisoned versions.

## Supply Chain Mechanics

### Maintainer Account Takeover

The `ehindero` account showed minimal recent activity — classic dormant maintainer targeting. Attackers likely obtained credentials via:

- Prior breach credential reuse
- Session token theft from maintainer workstation
- npm account without MFA (historical accounts)

### Typosquat Dependency Injection

Rather than modifying package source directly, attackers added:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "easy-day-js": "^1.11.10"
}
```

`easy-day-js` mirrors `dayjs` API surface — `npm install` resolves without obvious failure. The malicious code lives in **`setup.cjs`** executed via npm lifecycle hooks (`preinstall`/`postinstall`).

### Stage One — `setup.cjs`

1. Fingerprint host OS and architecture.
2. Download stage-two binary from attacker infrastructure.
3. Execute with hidden window / nohup persistence.
4. Register DGA-based fallback C2 if primary fails.

### Stage Two — Cross-Platform Backdoor

Capabilities observed:

- **Browser history** exfiltration
- **Extension data theft** from 166 targets including:
  - Crypto wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, Exodus, etc.)
  - Password managers (LastPass, Bitwarden, 1Password)
  - Productivity integrations (Zapier)
- **Persistence** via startup folder, crontab, or LaunchAgent
- **DGA C2** for resilient command channel

## Indicators of Compromise

| Indicator | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Package | `easy-day-js` any version |
| `@mastra/*` | Versions published 2026-06-17 01:12–02:36 UTC |
| Lockfile | Unexpected `easy-day-js` entry |
| Process | Node spawning unsigned binary from `/tmp` or `%TEMP%` |
| Network | HTTPS to fresh domains from build agents |

**npm audit** and **Socket.dev** flagged the dependency within hours — internal registries should block `easy-day-js` entirely.

## Impact

**Developers:** Local workstation compromise — extension vaults and browser sessions stolen.

**CI/CD:** Build agents running `npm install` without isolation become persistent backdoors in release pipelines.

**Crypto sector:** Wallet extension targeting indicates financial theft motivation consistent with Lazarus tradecraft.

**Downstream consumers:** Any application bundling `@mastra` dependencies during the compromise window.

## Mitigation

1. **Audit lockfiles** — search for `easy-day-js`; remove and regenerate lock.
2. **Pin `@mastra` packages** to versions **predating 2026-06-17 01:12 UTC**.
3. **Rotate all secrets** on machines that ran `npm install` during the window — API keys, npm tokens, cloud credentials.
4. **Enable npm MFA** on all maintainer accounts; remove dormant publishers from package access lists.
5. **CI hardening** — ephemeral build containers, no extension installs on build agents, `npm ci` with verified lockfile only.
6. **Block package** at artifact proxy — deny `easy-day-js` and flagged `@mastra` versions.

## Attribution Notes

OpenSourceMalware and community analysts note tradecraft overlap with **March 2026 Axios npm compromise** — typosquat dependency, `setup.cjs` loader, extension targeting, DGA C2. Lazarus attribution is **analyst consensus, not confirmed government attribution**.
