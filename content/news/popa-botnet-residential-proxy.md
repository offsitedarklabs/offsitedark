## Summary

Krebs on Security reported on June 18, 2026 that the **Popa botnet** — infecting unofficial **Android TV streaming boxes** via the **Vo1d** plugin framework — is linked to **NetNut**, a residential proxy service operated by **NASDAQ-listed Alarum Technologies**. Research from **Synthient** and **Qurium** found Popa SDK traffic forwarding through NetNut's proxy pool with **high confidence**.

Popa maintains **1.5–2.5 million unique IPs daily** across ~**250–300 controller addresses** — one of the largest residential proxy botnets active in 2026.

## Botnet Architecture

### Infection Vector

Popa spreads through **piracy streaming applications** on cheap Android TV boxes (MXQ, H96, generic Allwinner/AMLogic devices):

| App (reported) | Role |
|----------------|------|
| CRICFy | Cricket streaming |
| DooFlix | Movie/TV piracy |
| Rapid Streamz | Live TV piracy |
| Various Vo1d plugins | Modular malware loader |

Users purchase sub-$30 "fully loaded" boxes with pre-installed piracy apps — no technical sophistication required for infection.

### Vo1d Plugin Framework

Vo1d provides a plugin SDK embedded in piracy apps. Popa operates as a Vo1d plugin:

1. App installs with bundled Vo1d runtime.
2. Plugin enrolls device with Popa controllers.
3. Device proxies HTTP/S traffic for paying customers.
4. Revenue flows to botnet operators and allegedly NetNut resellers.

### Scale Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Daily unique IPs | 1.5–2.5 million |
| Controller addresses | ~250–300 |
| Publisher apps analyzed | 20+ without user consent |
| Smart TV expansion | LG webOS, Samsung Tizen apps with similar SDKs |

## NetNut / Alarum Connection

### Research Findings

Synthient and Qurium correlated:

- Popa SDK egress IPs matching NetNut residential proxy pool assignments
- TLS fingerprint and routing path overlap
- Temporal correlation between Popa enrollment spikes and NetNut capacity expansion

Krebs reporting places this in context of **NASDAQ-listed Alarum Technologies** — parent of NetNut — raising securities and regulatory questions about proxy sourcing transparency.

### Residential Proxy Abuse

Legitimate residential proxy services sell "real user IP" access for:

- Ad verification
- Web scraping
- Geo-restricted content testing

**Botnet-sourced proxies** provide the same product without consent — victims' bandwidth and IP reputation weaponized.

## Abuse Cases (Downstream)

Popa-proxied traffic reportedly used for:

- **Ad fraud** — click and impression inflation
- **Account takeovers** — ATO from residential IPs bypassing geo-velocity checks
- **AI training data scraping** — large-scale web harvesting appearing as organic users
- **Credential stuffing** — distributed low-and-slow attacks

## Indicators of Compromise

| Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Device | Cheap Android TV box with piracy apps installed |
| Network | Sustained outbound HTTP/S proxy traffic during idle |
| Process | Unknown background service in Vo1d-associated packages |
| Bandwidth | Consumer ISP complaints about unexplained usage spikes |

**Enterprise:** Popa devices on guest Wi-Fi can egress through corporate NAT — monitor for anomalous residential-device traffic patterns.

## Impact

**Device owners:** Bandwidth theft, legal exposure (traffic originates from their IP), device performance degradation.

**Targets of proxied traffic:** Fraud, scraping, attacks appearing from residential IPs.

**Market:** Legitimate proxy industry reputational damage; compliance challenges for customers sourcing proxies.

## Mitigation

1. **Avoid piracy streaming apps** and "fully loaded" TV boxes.
2. **Block residential proxy SDK domains** at network perimeter — Qurium/Synthient published domain lists.
3. **Smart TV audit** — review LG webOS and Samsung Tizen app permissions; remove unknown streaming apps.
4. **Guest network isolation** — IoT and media devices without route to corporate resources.
5. **Vendor due diligence** — proxy customers should verify IP sourcing compliance from providers.
