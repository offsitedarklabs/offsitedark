## Summary

Clergy member **mastercodeon** published **Peercord** to Church of Malware git on **June 17, 2026**. Peercord is a **JavaScript-based decentralized social media platform** positioned as a **Discord alternative** with peer-to-peer architecture — no central server required for message relay between participants.

Peercord joins other **censorship-resistant tooling** hosted on Church of Malware git outside mainstream platforms, alongside prior community releases in malware research, offensive tooling, and infrastructure.

## Architecture

### Design Goals

| Goal | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Decentralization | P2P message routing without single relay authority |
| Discord-like UX | Channels, rooms, voice-adjacent features (roadmap) |
| Resilience | Network survives individual node takedown |
| Privacy | Reduced metadata collection vs centralized platforms |

### Technical Stack

- **Language:** JavaScript (Node.js / browser-compatible components)
- **Transport:** WebRTC data channels and/or libp2p-style peer discovery (implementation-specific — see repository)
- **Identity:** Cryptographic keypairs — no email registration requirement
- **Persistence:** Local-first message storage with optional distributed backup

### P2P Model

Unlike Discord's hub-and-spoke model (all traffic through Discord Inc. servers), Peercord nodes communicate directly or via ephemeral relays:

1. Peer discovery via DHT, invite links, or bootstrap nodes.
2. End-to-end encrypted message exchange between participants.
3. Room state synchronized across peer mesh.
4. No corporate entity holds conversation plaintext.

**Tradeoff:** P2P chat sacrifices moderation scalability and legal compliance tooling that centralized platforms provide — by design for this community's use case.

## Use Cases

### Offensive Security Community

- **Operational channels** resistant to platform bans
- **Tooling coordination** without Telegram/Discord deplatforming risk
- **Research collaboration** with reduced third-party data exposure

### General P2P

- Privacy-conscious team communication
- Disaster-resilient messaging when central infra fails
- Jurisdictional censorship circumvention

## Church of Malware Ecosystem

### Community Codex Edition 01 (Summer 2026)

The Community Codex remains listed as active on `churchofmalware.org`. No new scripture articles were timestamped within the June 16–19 window — member-published tooling dominated community activity.

### Related Infrastructure

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `git.churchofmalware.org` | Self-hosted Gitea — tool and source distribution |
| `churchofmalware.org` | Community portal and scripture archive |
| Church of Malware X/Twitter | Announcement channel |

Peercord may eventually replace or supplement Discord/Telegram for internal community coordination — adoption timeline unknown.

## Security Considerations

### For Operators

- P2P exposes participant IP addresses to mesh peers — use VPN/Tor overlay if IP privacy required.
- Bootstrap nodes are trust anchors — verify bootstrap source integrity.
- JavaScript supply chain — audit dependencies before deployment.

### For Defenders

- P2P chat is not inherently malicious — but provides C2-adjacent communication patterns.
- Network monitoring: WebRTC and DHT traffic may indicate P2P application use.
- No centralized lawful access point — investigations require endpoint forensics.

## Comparison

| Feature | Discord | Peercord |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Central server | Yes | No (P2P) |
| E2E encryption | Optional (limited) | Core design |
| Moderation | Platform-controlled | Community/distributed |
| Deplatforming risk | High | Low |
| UX maturity | High | Early |
